# Summary

Some writers need external motivation to keep themselves accountable. Enter Iterate, an early-in-development application to gamify the writing experience.
Each day you log in, you can set a goal. When you meet it, you earn a streak. If you don't write until the end of the next day, you lose your streak.

You can also, save, edit, and delete your work - manage all your chapters or articles here!

"Write" now, the streak feature is the key feature of the application.

Future features will include:

1. Set goals for each day of the week.
2. More styling options.
3. Pomodoro timer
4. Leaderboards and "multiplayer" writing competitions

# How to use the API

The api for this project lets you perform GET and POST requests to fetch from and contribute to the users, and story databases
Here are some examples of how to use the API:

(Unprotected Endpoint)GET /myworks?userid=userid
(you will not be able to see your userid without web dev tools)
Register: POST /signup - takes in user_name, password, full_name, nickname > Returns a bearer authentication token for the user
Example request body:
{
user_name: "testuser",
password: "Testpass01!",
full_name: "Test User"
nickname: "Mister Test"
}
My works: /myworks

GET requests need a userid in the query, which will return all works for that user.

POST requests must include {title, content, wordcount} and will be given a UUID.

DELETE requests must include the UUID in the param, such as "/myworks/id/:id"

PATCH requests require a PATCH to the UUID, such as "/myworks/id:id" and must include {title, content, wordcount} to be changed

Streak:

GET "/streak?userid=id" will return the current streak for the user

POST "/streak/check" requires a {userid} in the req body and adds a new streak. This also sets the last streak date for the user if none exists.
